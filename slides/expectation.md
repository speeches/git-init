# Git does not manage

- Software Version (i.e. 1.2.3 semver)
- Binary file or Zip file (dependencies, artifacts, deploykit)

---

# Git replaces

- our crazy folder naming convention `_v1`, `_old`, `_bkp`, ` (1)`
- our fear of deleting an unused (but potentially helpful in the future) file

---

# Git introduces

- Working together (in a safe way)
- Branches concept
- ... a lot of advanced things
