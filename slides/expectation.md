## tuning of our
# expectation

---

# Git do not manage

- Software Version (i.e. 1.2.3 semver)
- Binary file or Zip file (dependencies, artifacts, deploykit)

---

# Git replace

- our crazy folder naming convention `_v1`, `_old`, `_bkp`, ` (1)`
- our fear to delete an unused file (but potentially helpful in future)

---

# Git Add

- Working together (managing conflicts if necessary)
- Branches
- ... a lot of advanced things
