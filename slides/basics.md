>
> `Thumbs.db` on Windows

You can defire to ignore some file in your project

> i.e:
> `*.tmp`, `*obj` extensions

# Respository

The repository with all changes is always with you!

Even offline!

If you are using a remote repository you can define where and when do sync

# Staging Area

When you make changes, you have 3 choices:

- Commit changes
- Revert changes
- Keep changes (but not commit)

All changes in staging area will be committed
